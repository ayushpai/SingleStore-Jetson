# SingleStore NVIDIA Jetson Robot Control with OpenAI GPT Integration

The NVIDIA Jetson is a series of embedded computing boards developed by NVIDIA. Designed for accelerating machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision applications, the Jetson platform is built around an NVIDIA GPU. It features high-performance processing for real-time artificial intelligence (AI) on-edge devices. The platform is widely used in robotics, drones, and other IoT devices where local AI processing is needed.

In this project, we are focusing on the NVIDIA Jetbot. Here are hardware instructions from NVIDIA on how to build this type of robot:
